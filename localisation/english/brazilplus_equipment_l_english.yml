 BRA_rocket_artillery_equipment_2_desc:0 "Paradoxically the F-114-R-E was Brazil's first attempt at an unguided rocket, despite being more complex and bigger than the F-108. The size was imposed by the fact that the only rocket-grade tubes being manufactured in Brazil at the time were of 144mm size, built by the Navy. The powder-propelled rocket was 1.80m long, had stabilizing fins and a range of 22km. Despite sucesfull tests, it was abandoned in favour of the F-108 in 1956. It would eventually be revived in 1957 as the basis of a two-stage artillery rocket, the F-114-DE, and of other testing and souding rockets."

 BRA_fighter_equipment_0: "Muniz M-7" 
 BRA_fighter_equipment_0_short: "M-7"
 BRA_fighter_equipment_0_desc: "The Muniz M-7 was Brazil's first serially produced aircraft. Designed by Army Major Antônio Guedes Muniz it first flew in 1935. 28 units were built between 1937 and 1941, some being used as trainer aircraft by the military aviation schools." 
 BRA_fighter_equipment_1: "Instituto de Pesquisas Tecnológicas IPT-0 Bichinho"
 BRA_fighter_equipment_1_short: "IPT-0" 
 BRA_fighter_equipment_1_desc: "The initial IPT-0 design, from 1938, predates the creation of the Aeronautics Section of the IPT, being retroactively designated as the project 0 for this reason. The Bichinho was an experimental acrobatic and sports aircraft first flown in 1940. Four were built, each experimenting new designs and motorization options. By all accounts the design, albeit limited, had excellent handling characteristics, described as 'agile' and as having 'a high performance'. This imagined military version is inspired by the similarly sized Soviet I-16 Rata."

 BRA_nav_bomber_equipment_0_short: "HL-3"
 BRA_nav_bomber_equipment_0_desc: "Despite having a reasonably vibrant aviation cocmunity, Brazilian authorities feared that the amount of skilled pilots in the country was insufficient in the context of the brewing war in Europe. The HL-3 was intended as a very simple trainer aircraft to be distributed to air clubs to help bridge that gap. Only 6 were built, however. Despite being put to good use, the abundance of other more advanced trainer options meant that there was no demand for the HL-3." 
 BRA_nav_bomber_equipment_1: "Bresciani Petróleo Torpedeiro"
 BRA_nav_bomber_equipment_1_short: "Br.PT"  
 BRA_nav_bomber_equipment_1_desc: "The Petróleo was designed by Italian immigrant Bresciani, which had previous experience in building light aircraft in Europe. Bresciani sought funding from the owner of CAP Francisco Pignatari to build two designs: the Café and the Petróleo. Both aircraft were two-seat monoplane single-engined aircraft described as so underpowered as to be unsafe to fly. This is an imagined remotorized and redesigned version of the Café adapted as a torpedo bomber."

 BRA_nav_bomber_equipment_2_short: "IPT-11" 
 BRA_nav_bomber_equipment_2_desc: "The IPT-11 was conceived in 1947 as an high performance trainer aircraft for the military. The basic design was completed, which demonstrated a more ambitious and complex aircraft if compared with similar designs being proposed in Brazil at the time. However, the abundance of cheap lend lease aircraft meant that there was no interested parties and no prototype was built. This version is a imagined light attack version of the Bichão."

 BRA_nav_bomber_equipment_3_desc: "In the 1960's the Navy, after acquiring the Minas Gerais carrier, sought a local solution for a carrier capable trainer aircraft from engineer Marc William Niess. The Fragata was designed as a biplace low-wing monoplane with foldable wings for carrier operations. It was cancelled in 1961, in its advanced design phase, after infighting in the armed forces led the Navy to be barred from operating fixed-wing aircraft."

 BRA_scout_plane_equipment_1_desc: "The IPT-4 was the original design by IPT that led to the CAP-1 and CAP-3 series of aircraft. The design was reportedly good, easy to fly and with 'excellent' performance, which led to it being acquired by the CAP company following its inaugural flight. Changes to the design made by CAP, to make it easier to produce, reportedly led to the serious issues that the CAP-1 and 3 series faced over its lifetime."

 #Tactical Bombers
 BRA_tac_bomber_equipment_0: "Henrique Lage HL-8B" 
 BRA_tac_bomber_equipment_0_short: "HL-8B"
 BRA_tac_bomber_equipment_0_desc: "The HL-8 was Brazil's first trimotor aircraft, debuting in its first flight in 1942. It was designed as a transport plane capable of ferrying passengers or 1000kg of cargo. The initial design had a traditional tail section, but the first (and only) prototype sported a twin tail design. The flooding of American transport planes via the lend-lease program meant that no orders were made of the HL-8. Here the HL-8B is represented in a imagined medium bomber function, akin to similar aircraft like the Italian SM.79." 
 BRA_tac_bomber_equipment_1: "Fábrica do Galeão 2FG"
 BRA_tac_bomber_equipment_1_short: "2FG" 
 BRA_tac_bomber_equipment_1_desc: "In 1938 the Brazilian Navy signed a deal with the German FockeWulf to build a series of aircraft under license in Brazil. The idea was to kickstart Brazil's aviation industry by generating a qualified workforce. One of the aircraft to which a license was negotiated was the Fw58 of which 25 were built in Brazil as the 2FG, most with some degree of nationalization particularly after the war begun. The 2FG were intended as a twin-engined trainer, but served also as a bomber and patrol aircraft during the war."

 BRA_tac_bomber_equipment_2_short: "IPT-8" 
 BRA_tac_bomber_equipment_2_desc: "In 1944 the Air Force Ministry made it public that it had interest in developing a local twin-engine transport aircraft. While the Air Force never followed through with its interest, it stimulated a few designers to come up with projects that fit that role. At IPT, Romeu Corsini came up with two designs: the IPT-8 and IPT-9. The IPT-8 was to be a twin-engine low wing monoplane with a twin-tail. The prototype was never completed, as the end of the war brought a massive surplus of transports to the market."

This led the Besouro to be the first jet build in Brazil, completed in 1957. After the cancellation of the pulse-jet program the Besouro was intended to be powered by two Turbomeca Palas engines, but lack of interest meant that it never received its engines, only flying a few times under tow before being scrapped."

 BRA_strat_bomber_equipment_3_desc: "The HL-10 would have been Brazil's first four-engine indigenous aircraft. Very little is known about this project, it was likely started prior to 1948, before CNNA became ETAE as it inherited a HL designation, albeit being also known as the ETAE-11. Construction of a prototype reportedly started but did not finish before 1951 when ETAE ceased operations. Some sources claim that work continued until 1955 when it was scrapped. No drawings or photos survived, with witnesses claiming it resembled the Boeing 307."
